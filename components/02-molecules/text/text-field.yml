  <p>“From scholars and researchers to politicians and athletes, we have produced some of the world’s most influential leaders since the school’s inception in 1822. To date, we have put forward more presidents and deans of colleges, universities and seminaries, as well as heads of denominations, than any other divinity school or seminary in the United States. Our faculty, too, have been — and continue to be — among the most prominent religion scholars of their day.”</p>
