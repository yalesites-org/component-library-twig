accordion__item__content: '<div class="text-field"><p>If you uploaded your photo to the <a href="https://idcenter.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale ID center</a> by the stated deadline, your card will be available for pickup from the YDS Registrar’s office during BTFO. You will need to pick up your ID card in person. If you did not submit a photo, the Registrar’s office can give you a paper authorization card that you can bring to the ID Center, along with a separate photo ID, to have your card made. Check the ID center’s website to see if they are requiring appointments for visits.</p></div>'
