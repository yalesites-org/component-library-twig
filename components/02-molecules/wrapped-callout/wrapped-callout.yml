What’s new about their approach is they will study protein structures by infrared microscopy rather than fluorescence microscopy. They expect these images to reveal a new localized layer of cellular metabolism that could be used to re-engineer metabolic processes. In the future, these complementary time-resolved imaging and cross-linking approaches could be extended to biological studies of macromolecular assemblies and phase-separated membraneless organelles that have been historically difficult to study.</p>'

This includes supporting positive relations between management and staff, alignment with university policies, and developing strategies geared towards talent, engagement, wellness, or belonging for the organization and its employees who are at the heart of it all.</p><p>“We are here to help provide solutions and offer an understanding of the unit’s culture and climate to leadership,” said Tricia Napor, senior director of employee relations. “A new leader may want to reorganize their team in a way that requires thoughtful change management. A manager might require help understanding how to repurpose a role on their team or how to interpret a policy. A staff member may have a question about compensation or seek guidance in how to give feedback to a team member. We work to understand what these individuals are trying to achieve, and partner on solutions, whether for the overall unit or the individual’s career.”</p><p>HRBPs assess staffing needs and support departments during the hiring process in partnership with the Talent Acquisition team. They work with staff throughout their employment at Yale and play a critical role in talent planning and the performance management and merit processes. “Each fall, we partner with most of the units on campus to identify high potential individuals as possible successors for leadership roles. In the spring, we collaborate with business offices and clients to calibrate merit ratings,” said Napor.</p>'
