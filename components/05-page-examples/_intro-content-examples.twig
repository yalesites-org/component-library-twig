She completed her postdoctoral training with Dr. Martin Gruebele at the Center for the Physics of Living Cells at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she developed a method for studying protein thermodynamics and kinetics in differentiated tissues of living zebrafish and she developed a mimic of cytoplasm that can be used to reproduce protein behaviors in vitro. She came to Yale as a faculty member in 2020.</p>',
