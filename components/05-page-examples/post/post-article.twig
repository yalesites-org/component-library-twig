Adding to the difficulty is that experimental tools do not currently exist to characterize filaments inside cells with high structural specificity or to quantify the effect of filamentation on enzyme function.</p><p>“The problem is a lot of imaging research that’s done uses fluorescent proteins or fluorescent molecules to tag the protein that you’re looking at, and anything that you do to perturb the protein can affect what’s going on inside cells,” said Davis. “So, if you add a tag onto it, then you’re changing the environment.”</p><p>This is where the expertise of Davis and Plate come together. The Plate lab will provide proficiency in chemical biology and proteomics methods to map the dynamics of protein interactions during the metabolon assembly, while the Davis lab will contribute the infrared imaging to monitor structural changes in live cells.</p><p>Davis explained by using infrared spectroscopy, which is a label-free approach and therefore minimally invasive, researchers can see what’s going on with proteins without changing anything inside the cell. Lars is designing a very small tag to use in the infrared to attract the protein and prove that it is the protein interest.</p><p>The team hypothesizes that cells form distinct types of filaments, activated and inhibited, with unique structures that fine-tune metabolic activity. What’s new about their approach is they will study protein structures by infrared microscopy rather than fluorescence microscopy. They expect these images to reveal a new localized layer of cellular metabolism that could be used to re-engineer metabolic processes. In the future, these complementary time-resolved imaging and cross-linking approaches could be extended to biological studies of macromolecular assemblies and phase-separated membraneless organelles that have been historically difficult to study.</p>',
